# Report Project

This repository is divided into two main parts: report-api and report-ui. 

## report-ui

The report-ui directory contains a standalone Angular application in version 17. This project strives to follow Angular documentation guidelines. Regarding unit tests for the application, most of them have been written.
Functionally speaking, I hope it meets the expectations. I did my best according to my understanding of the test case outlined in the PDF.

## report-api

The `report-api` directory is a NestJS project designed for mocking endpoints used by the front-end. It's important to note that the code in `report-api` is not clean and hasn't been tested. Its primary purpose is to provide simulated endpoints for easing front-end development.
